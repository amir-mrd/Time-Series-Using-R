# Time Series Analysis

## Analysis and Prediction of BHP Stocks Price in R

Data collected in a chronological sequence is known as time-series data. Often, it is gathered at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or annually. By plotting this type of data, patterns such as trends, seasonality, or a mix of both can be observed. Recognizing these patterns can aid in decision-making. For instance, discerning a seasonal pattern in stock prices can help determine the optimal times to buy or sell shares. In R, data decomposition allows for a more detailed examination of these patterns.

In this analysis I analysed Stock price of BHP from Asutralian Stocks Exchange (AX) for a period of seven years (2015-2021).
I used Naive and ARIMA Models to predict the future stocks price. Bothe models were evaluated using their accuracies and their residuals. A comparision between BHP stocks price and three other Australian mining giants (Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group Limited, Newcrest Mining Limited, were also made.
